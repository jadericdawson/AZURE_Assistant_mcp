# F-35 MANPOWER PROJECT - FINAL REPORT

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The F-35 enterprise is operating with a persistent manpower deficit that now stands at roughly one‐sixth of its validated requirement.  As detailed in Table 1 of the forthcoming Data Appendix, the Department of Defense is short **≈1,098 maintainers** and **≈300 pilots**, amounting to a combined gap of **15–20 percent** once cross-functional billets (ALIS/ODIN administrators and cyber specialists) are included.  While the absolute numbers are modest relative to the fleet’s 9,000-plus personnel requirement, their concentration in critical skill sets—low-observable structures, avionics, and instructor pilots—magnifies operational risk.

Readiness metrics have stalled accordingly.  Mission-Capable (MC) rates for the joint fleet have hovered between **55 and 60 percent** for the past three fiscal years, a full ten points below the program’s 70 percent interim goal and twenty points shy of the original 80 percent threshold.  RAND modelling and GAO field data show that each percentage-point of maintainer shortage translates into a **0.6 percent reduction in sortie generation**, yielding **10–12 percent fewer sorties per month** for under-manned squadrons.  Depot backlogs linked to the maintainer gap now account for 37 percent of overdue work packages, compounding aircraft downtime and driving Non-Mission-Capable days to an average of 131 per tail in FY 2021.

Three structural drivers underpin the shortfall.  First, **training-pipeline bottlenecks** constrain both maintainer and pilot production: maintenance schoolhouses are running at only 85–90 percent throughput, and pilot B-Course capacity trails demand by 22–30 percent, leaving a backlog of roughly 150 aviators awaiting initial qualification.  Second, **retention challenges**—fuelled by high airline hiring for pilots and operational burnout for maintainers—are eroding experienced cadres at annual rates of seven and nine percent, respectively.  Third, the **intrinsic complexity of the platform**—low-observable coatings, ODIN’s cyber-centric diagnostics, and rapidly evolving Block 4 software—adds about 30 percent to the time required to produce a fully-qualified maintainer and demands new cyber-savvy skills that traditional accession pipelines do not yet supply.

Mitigation efforts are under way but will take time to mature.  The Services are expanding training capacity with additional simulators and crew-chief school seats slated to come online by **FY 2025**, while a surge of **~1,500 contractor maintainers** funded through the Lot 15–17 sustainment contract provides near-term relief.  The ODIN data environment, projected to be fully fielded by **Q2 FY 2026**, promises a 30 percent reduction in maintainer labour hours through automation and predictive analytics.  Retention incentives—up to **$15 k per year for avionics maintainers** and **$35 k for instructor pilots**—aim to stem attrition, though their efficacy remains unproven.  If current recovery plans hold, the Marine Corps projects full maintainer manning by **FY 2024**, the Navy by **FY 2026**, and the Air Force by **FY 2027**; pilot parity is expected between **FY 2026 and FY 2028** depending on simulator deliveries and instructor-pilot staffing.



# 4. Current Manpower Baseline Assessment

The F-35 manpower baseline is best understood through two complementary lenses: quantitative inventory gaps and the qualitative factors that sustain them.  Tables 1 and 2, to be published in the Data Appendix, enumerate the detailed shortfalls by Service; the narrative below synthesises those figures with causal analysis and readiness implications.

### 4.1 Maintainer Inventory

According to GAO-22-105995, the DoD required **9,075 maintainers** to support the F-35 fleet in FY 2021 but had only **7,977 personnel assigned**, yielding a net deficit of **≈1,098 billets** (see Table 1).  The Air Force shoulders roughly **64 percent** of that gap, with **698 crew chiefs and avionics specialists** missing from its active and reserve components.  Navy and Marine Corps deficits stand at **268** and **132** respectively, equating to under-manning rates of **12 percent (USN)** and **7 percent (USMC)**.

Historical data show the situation deteriorated before plateauing: the Air Force gap widened from **-515 maintainers in 2019 to ‑698 in 2021**, while Navy and Marine Corps under-manning has hovered near **10 percent** since FY 2018 despite modest accession increases.  Service recovery plans target full parity by FY 2027 (USAF), FY 2026 (USN), and FY 2024 (USMC), contingent on training-pipeline expansion and attrition control.

### 4.2 Pilot Inventory

Pilot manning shortfalls, though numerically smaller, pose an equally acute readiness risk.  The Joint Program Office’s February 2023 Manpower Status Brief cites a requirement for **≈1,900 qualified F-35 pilots** against an inventory of **≈1,600**, creating a **-300 pilot (-16 percent) gap** (see Table 2).  Service breakdowns mirror the maintainer pattern: the Air Force lacks **210 pilots (-17 percent)**, the Navy **50 (-13 percent)**, and the Marine Corps **40 (-15 percent)**.

Annual training throughput is the binding constraint.  Current schoolhouse capacity delivers **120–140 new pilots per year**, short of the **≈180** required to close the gap while accommodating fleet growth.  The backlog awaiting initial qualification has swollen to **≈150 pilots**, and instructor-pilot billets are only **80 percent** filled, further constraining throughput.

### 4.3 Qualitative Drivers of the Shortfall

Root-cause analysis identifies four dominant themes:

1. **Training-Pipeline Bottlenecks** – Maintenance training centres operate at **85–90 percent** throughput because of instructor shortages and limited simulators, while pilot B-Courses face a **22–30 percent** annual throughput deficit.  Time to produce a fully-qualified maintainer now averages **18–24 months**, versus a planned 12-month pipeline.

2. **Competition for Experienced Personnel** – Legacy platforms (F-15, F-16, F/A-18) continue to demand seasoned maintainers and pilots, dampening cross-flow into F-35 units.  High airline hiring has likewise accelerated pilot attrition to **≈7 percent per year**.

3. **Platform Complexity and Skill Mismatch** – Advanced LO coatings and the ODIN data environment extend maintainer training time by **≈30 percent** over legacy systems and require cyber-savvy skill sets that are in short supply.  Surveys reveal that **25 percent of maintainers** have fewer than three years’ experience on the platform, eroding depth of expertise.

4. **Administrative Friction** – Security-clearance processing exceeds **180 days for maintainers** and **190 days for foreign-partner pilots**, delaying accession and compounding existing vacancies.

### 4.4 Readiness Impact

The operational consequences are both immediate and measurable.  GAO and DOT&E link manpower deficits to a **10-percentage-point drag on MC rates**, locking the fleet at **55–60 percent** versus the program’s 70 percent target.  Units with <90 percent pilot manning generate **10–12 percent fewer sorties**, while a **15 percent maintainer deficit** can reduce sortie generation capacity by up to **14 percent** during surge operations (RAND TR-11456, 2022).  Depot backlogs attributed to maintainer shortages account for **37 percent of overdue work packages**, and Non-Mission-Capable days averaged **131 per aircraft in FY 2021**, far above the 90-day benchmark.

In short, today’s manpower shortfalls constitute the principal lever—more so than parts availability or software maturity—for elevating fleet readiness.  The following sections will examine forward-looking force-structure scenarios and the cost-benefit calculus of proposed mitigation strategies aimed at restoring full manning by the latter half of this decade.



## 6. Cost Analysis and Budget Implications

### 6.1 Overview of Current Spend on Manpower Mitigation

The Department of Defense has already committed more than $8 billion in discrete line items aimed primarily at back-stopping the F-35 manpower gap rather than directly procuring additional aircraft or weapons.  The largest tranche is the three-year, Lot 15-17 Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) augmentation awarded to Lockheed Martin in August 2022.  Valued at approximately **$6.6 billion**, the contract funds a surge of roughly 1,500 contractor maintainers through FY 2025—sufficient to offset just over half of today’s 1,800-person maintainer deficit but only for the contract’s duration.  A second, technology-centric outlay is the **$1.1 billion Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN) programme** that runs through FY 2025; ODIN’s predictive analytics are projected to cut maintainer labour hours by 30 percent and thereby reduce recurring personnel costs once fully fielded by Q2 FY 2026.

Less visible but still material are the personnel-related supplements that the Services have tacked onto their operations and maintenance (O&M) accounts.  Air Force data show that F-35 units alone consumed **$68 million in overtime pay during FY 2021**, roughly quadruple the level recorded in FY 2018 as commanders attempted to close daily sortie gaps with longer shifts.  Congress further authorised Selective Retention Bonuses of up to $15,000 per year for critical avionics and low-observable maintenance specialties; the resulting **$45 million incentive pool over a three-year window** appears modest in isolation but establishes a recurring bill that competes with other readiness accounts.

### 6.2 Near-Term Budget Effects (FY 2024–FY 2026)

In the near term, closing manpower shortfalls will drive O&M costs higher before any savings materialise.  The F-35 Program Office projects that contractor labour will remain the costliest line item through FY 2026, peaking at **$2.3 billion in FY 2024**—fully 35 percent of the enterprise sustainment budget for that year—before tapering as uniformed billets fill.  Simultaneously, the Services plan to expand training pipelines: the Air Force alone will add 50 crew-chief school seats and eight Full Mission Simulators, a combination forecast to cost **$310 million in Military Personnel (MILPERS) and Procurement accounts** over the FYDP.  When overtime relief and bonus outlays are added, the aggregate near-term cash requirement to stabilise the workforce hovers near **$9 billion**.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has warned that these near-term expenditures will likely appear as incremental, rather than one-time, adds to the baseline because even a successful ramp-up of uniformed manpower does not fully eliminate the need for contractor expertise—particularly in software, cybersecurity, and ODIN administration.  Consequently, the Services risk creating a dual-payroll construct in which organic billets grow while contractor presence declines only marginally, locking in a blended labour model that may cost 10–15 percent more per maintainer-equivalent than an all-organic force.

### 6.3 Long-Term Budget Implications (FY 2027 and Beyond)

From FY 2027 onward the cost curve hinges on the degree to which technology investments actually displace labour.  Program-office estimates assume that ODIN and condition-based maintenance (CBM+) analytics—validated in a 2021 pilot as capable of avoiding **$250 million per year in depot repairs**—will enable manpower to scale more efficiently with the fleet’s growth from 450 to roughly 600 aircraft by FY 2030.  If ODIN realises the projected 30 percent labour-hour reduction, the Services could trim approximately **$400 million per year** in uniformed and contractor payroll relative to a status-quo baseline.  Conversely, if fielding slips or the analytics under-perform, the payroll bill could increase by **$600–700 million annually** as additional maintainers are hired to meet sortie-generation requirements.

Another long-run consideration is the opportunity cost of sustained manpower shortfalls.  GAO has calculated that each percentage-point drag on the Mission-Capable rate translates into **$120 million in additional O&S spending across the fleet** due to extended depot queues and cannibalisation-driven parts attrition.  At today’s 10-point MC deficit, that equates to a hidden tax of roughly **$1.2 billion per year**—effectively offsetting many of the savings touted for ODIN and CBM+.  Therefore, delaying investment in manpower recovery may prove more expensive than the upfront cost of accelerated hiring and training.

### 6.4 Cost-Benefit Balance and Funding Strategy

Taken together, the data suggest that the fiscal breakeven point for manpower recovery occurs around FY 2028.  Under the Joint Program Office’s median scenario—full maintainer manning by FY 2027 and pilot parity by FY 2028—cumulative spending on CLS, bonuses, overtime, and training expansion totals **≈$11.2 billion** between FY 2023 and FY 2028.  The same scenario projects **$1.6 billion in annualised savings** thereafter from reduced contractor reliance and maintenance-efficiency gains, allowing the investment to amortise over roughly seven years.  By contrast, a delayed recovery that extends contractor support and overtime through FY 2030 would lift cumulative costs past **$15 billion** with no corresponding readiness dividend, pushing breakeven beyond the end of the aircraft’s current Block 4 development phase.

Congressional appropriation committees have already signalled scepticism of open-ended CLS funding, inserting a statutory requirement in the FY 2023 NDAA for the Services to certify "meaningful year-over-year reductions" in contractor head-count as a condition of continued sustainment appropriations.  Meeting this mandate will require the Services to front-load investments in training infrastructure—particularly simulators and instructor cadres—so that organic billets can replace contractor positions on schedule.  Failure to do so risks a funding clamp that could exacerbate manpower shortfalls and drive readiness even lower.

In summary, the cost analysis underscores a classic pay-now-or-pay-later dynamic.  Front-loading investments in manpower and enabling technologies demands significant near-term cash—on the order of **$9–10 billion through FY 2026**—but offers a plausible path to recoup those costs within a decade.  Deferral, by contrast, preserves budget headroom in the next two fiscal cycles at the expense of higher recurring O&S costs and chronic readiness penalties that could ultimately cost more than timely remediation.



## 7. Training Pipeline and Readiness Metrics

The capacity of the F-35 training system—both for maintainers and pilots—has emerged as the single most important constraint on the enterprise’s ability to close its enduring manpower gaps.  While the Services have succeeded in funding additional accessions, the physical and human infrastructure that turns recruits into qualified crew chiefs or combat-ready aviators has not scaled at a commensurate pace.  The result is a production deficit that now affects every link in the readiness chain, from daily sortie generation to long-range force-structure growth.

### 7.1 Maintainer Training Throughput

Maintenance schoolhouses at Eglin AFB, Luke AFB, and the East Coast Fleet Readiness Centers collectively graduated **approximately 1,850 F-35 maintainers in FY 2022**, representing **85–90 percent of their validated throughput capacity**.  Instructor shortfalls—especially among 7-level avionics technicians and low-observable (LO) specialists—explain much of the shortfall; manning documents show the instructor cadre filled at only **83 percent** across the three sites.  Simulator availability is the second limiting factor: with an average of **11 operational bays versus 14 required**, students frequently wait days for a training slot, lengthening the pipeline.  Consequently, the time required to produce a fully-qualified 5-level maintainer has stretched to **18–24 months**, a full six to twelve months longer than the program of record envisioned.

Table 3 (to be created) will juxtapose the **validated requirement of 2,050 maintainers per year**—the figure necessary to eliminate today’s 1,098-billet deficit by FY 2027—against the **actual output of 1,850** and the planned capacity increase to **≈2,300 per year once additional simulators and classrooms come on-line in FY 2025**.  The delta of **200–250 billets per year** explains why the Air Force’s recovery timeline now extends to FY 2027 rather than FY 2025 as originally briefed to Congress.

### 7.2 Pilot Production Bottlenecks

On the pilot side, the picture is equally constrained.  The four Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS)/B-Course hubs—Luke AFB, Eglin AFB, MCAS Beaufort, and NAS Lemoore—produced **between 120 and 140 new F-35 pilots in FY 2023**, versus the **≈180 graduates per year** required to erase the current **300-pilot deficit** and keep pace with aircraft deliveries.  The most acute bottleneck is instructor-pilot (IP) availability: AETC data place IP billets at **only 80 percent fill**, a shortfall that forces cancelled sorties and elongated syllabi.  A second constraint is the limited number of high-fidelity Full Mission Simulators (FMS).  Luke AFB, for example, operates **12 FMS bays but needs 16** to achieve surge throughput; students therefore log fewer synthetic flight hours than syllabus standards dictate, pushing additional training into live-fly windows already saturated by operational units.

### 7.3 Simulator Expansion and Instructor Staffing Plans

All three Services have programmed significant investments to break these bottlenecks.  The FY 2024 President’s Budget funds **eight new FMS devices**—four at Luke AFB and four at NAS Lemoore—scheduled for delivery by **Q4 FY 2025**.  The Joint Program Office estimates the additional devices will raise pilot-training capacity **by roughly 25 percent**, enough to graduate **≈175 aviators annually** even without a full complement of IPs.  Parallel efforts are under way to stabilize the instructor cadre: the FY 2022 NDAA authorised **$35 k annual retention bonuses** for IPs, and early indications from AETC show a **15 percent reduction in mid-career resignations** during the first two quarters of FY 2023.  For maintainers, Luke AFB received funding for **six additional virtual-reality maintenance trainers**, expected to cut hands-on lab time by **20 percent** and open **≈250 extra school seats per year** once operational in early FY 2025.

Table 4 (to be created) will catalogue these simulator deliveries and instructor-manpower initiatives, mapping each investment to its projected capacity gain and readiness payoff.  The table will also delineate milestones—such as the **IOC of the new VR maintenance labs in 2Q FY 2025**—which serve as gating events for the Services’ recovery timelines.

### 7.4 Readiness Consequences of Pipeline Shortfalls

The production deficits described above have a direct, quantifiable impact on fleet readiness.  GAO-22-105995 attributes **approximately 30 percent of the F-35’s Mission-Capable (MC) rate decline—from 63 percent in FY 2019 to 55 percent in FY 2021—to maintenance manpower shortages and delayed certification**.  RAND’s 2022 sortie-generation model further shows that each **1 percent maintainer gap reduces sortie production by 0.6 percent**, meaning today’s 12-percent aggregate deficit equates to **10–12 percent fewer sorties per squadron**.  On the flying side, units operating with **<90 percent pilot manning report Sortie Generation Rates (SGR) 10–12 percent lower** than fully manned units, a disparity the Services trace to reduced seasoning and the necessity to divert scarce pilots into instructor duties.

Put simply, the training pipeline is where readiness begins—or stalls.  Until the Services can graduate maintainers and pilots at rates that meet or exceed validated demand, the F-35 enterprise will remain trapped in a reactive posture, back-filling yesterday’s vacancies instead of posturing for tomorrow’s operational surge.  The forthcoming tables will provide a granular view of throughput requirements, current performance, and the investment profile intended to close the gap, offering decision-makers a data-driven roadmap for restoring the program to its planned readiness trajectory.



## 11. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies

Over the past four fiscal years the F-35 enterprise has operated with a manpower gap that averages 15–20 percent across maintainers, pilots, and cross-functional support billets.  This shortfall is not merely a head-count problem; it constitutes a compound readiness risk that depresses Mission-Capable rates by as much as 12 percentage points and constrains sortie generation during both steady-state and surge operations.  Drawing on GAO audits, RAND modelling, and Service readiness briefs, three risk vectors emerge as the dominant drivers of that readiness drag: (1) training-pipeline bottlenecks, (2) retention and experience erosion, and (3) platform-specific complexity that outstrips legacy skill sets.  The paragraphs that follow unpack each risk, describe the mitigation actions now under way, and assess residual exposure through FY 2028.

### 11.1 Training-Pipeline Bottlenecks

The single largest risk to manpower recovery is the capacity of Service schoolhouses and Fleet Replacement Squadrons to convert accessions into fully-qualified personnel.  Maintenance training centres are operating at only 85–90 percent throughput because instructor cadres remain under-manned and simulator bays are oversubscribed.  The result is an 18–24-month path to produce a 5-level maintainer—fully 30 percent longer than the original 12-month plan—while the pilot pipeline graduates just 120–140 aviators per year against a validated demand of roughly 180.  A backlog of 150 pilots is already awaiting initial qualification, and GAO-23-106864 warns that the gap could widen to more than 400 pilots by FY 2027 if throughput does not reach 180 per year.

Mitigation hinges on near-term capacity expansion and interim work-arounds.  The Air Force has added 50 crew-chief school seats and eight high-fidelity Full Mission Simulators at Luke AFB and NAS Lemoore; both projects achieve Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in FY 2025 and collectively raise maintainer and pilot throughput by approximately 25 percent.  Skill-level waivers authorised in 2021 allow partially-qualified maintainers to execute limited tasks during 120-day Temporary Duty assignments, buying time until the formal pipeline catches up.  For pilots, the Accelerated Path to Wings programme trims undergraduate training by 20 percent and channels graduates directly into the F-35 B-Course; its first cohort entered the syllabus in October 2022.  Nonetheless, any delay in simulator deliveries or instructor-pilot hiring could erode the projected recovery timelines of FY 2026 (USMC), FY 2027 (USN), and FY 2028 (USAF).

### 11.2 Retention and Experience Erosion

Even as throughput climbs, the Services must hold on to the personnel they already have.  Annual attrition averages nine percent among 5-level maintainers and seven percent among pilots—rates driven by operational tempo, airline hiring, and perceived career-progression delays.  Surveys cited in GAO-22-105995 show that 25 percent of maintainers have fewer than three years on the platform, eroding unit-level expertise and forcing junior teams to shoulder senior-level tasks.

Congress authorised selective reenlistment bonuses of up to $15 k per year for avionics and low-observable technicians and $35 k for instructor pilots beginning in FY 2022.  Early uptake is promising—Air Education & Training Command reports a 12-percentage-point decline in pilot resignation intent during the first six months—but definitive retention data will not be available until FY 2024 reenlistment cycles close.  Joint Service Maintenance Pooling, initiated under a June 2021 Memorandum of Agreement, offers an additional hedge by allowing USAF, USN, and USMC units to share intermediate-level maintenance resources; phase-in continues through FY 2025 and is expected to cut local under-manning by three to five percentage points at participating bases.

### 11.3 Platform Complexity and Skill Mismatch

The F-35’s advanced low-observable coatings, cyber-centric ODIN logistics environment, and rapidly evolving Block 4 software baseline together add roughly 30 percent to the training burden relative to legacy fighters.  They also create specialised niches—cybersecurity analysts, ODIN data architects, mission-data re-programmers—that traditional accession pipelines do not yet supply.  GAO counts roughly 250 vacancies across these cross-functional billets, and DOT&E’s FY 2022 report attributes a five- to seven-percentage-point reduction in MC rate to insufficient ODIN administrators alone.

Technology is both the source of, and the antidote to, this risk.  ODIN itself is projected to cut maintainer labour hours by 30 percent once fully fielded—initial hardware arrives on 33 aircraft by Q4 FY 2024, with fleet-wide rollout by Q2 FY 2026—while predictive maintenance analytics piloted with Palantir and KPMG could avoid $250 million in depot costs annually starting in FY 2024.  Trials of augmented-reality headsets at VX-23 demonstrated a 15–20 percent reduction in troubleshooting time; a procurement decision enters the FY 2023 Programme Objective Memorandum cycle.  Yet these benefits will materialise only if software schedules hold and if the Services can fill the 250-plus cyber and data-science billets embedded in ODIN’s Concept of Operations.

### 11.4 Aggregate Risk Outlook and Residual Exposure

Taken in aggregate, the mitigation portfolio—training expansion, contractor logistics support surge, ODIN automation, and targeted bonuses—has the potential to close the maintainer gap by FY 2027 and the pilot gap by FY 2028.  Contractor augmentation is already buying down risk in the near term: the Lot 15-17 sustainment contract funds approximately 1,500 maintainers through 2025 at a cost of $6.6 billion.  Depot workforce expansion at Ogden Air Logistics Complex adds 400 billets and a new hangar by January 2024, alleviating a key bottleneck in heavy maintenance.

Residual risks remain consequential.  First, funding for contractor support and bonuses sunsets after FY 2025 unless reauthorised; a lapse would re-open a deficit of up to 900 maintainers according to JPO modelling.  Second, ODIN’s schedule carries a medium likelihood of delay—Block 4 concurrency issues have already slipped related software drops by two quarters—which would defer the projected 30 percent labour-hour savings.  Third, external labour-market dynamics such as the ongoing airline-hiring surge could push pilot attrition above the seven-percent assumption baked into Service manning plans.  Finally, security-clearance processing times—now averaging 180 days for maintainers and 190 days for foreign-partner pilots—present a latent risk that, if unchecked, could offset up to 15 percent of projected training-pipeline gains.

To facilitate quantitative tracking of these risks, the Engineering team will populate Table 3 (forthcoming in the Tables pad) as a formal Risk Mitigation Matrix.  The table will list each risk event, its probability, readiness impact, current and planned mitigations, milestone timelines, and estimated residual risk post-mitigation.  The narrative above provides the source data and contextual detail that will anchor that matrix.
