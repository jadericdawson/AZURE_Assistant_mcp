# ðŸ”§ JSON Response Format Fix

## Problem

Azure OpenAI API requires that when using `response_format={"type": "json_object"}`, the system message **must contain the word "json"** explicitly.

### Error Message
```
'messages' must contain the word 'json' in some form, to use 'response_format' of type 'json_object'
```

## Solution Applied

Updated all agent personas to explicitly mention JSON in their system messages:

### âœ… Updated Agents

1. **Writer** - Line 2340
   - Added: "You MUST respond in JSON format"
   - Added section 6: "**RESPONSE FORMAT**: You MUST respond with a valid JSON object"
   - Added section 7: "NEVER respond with plain text. Always use JSON format"

2. **Engineer** - Line 2333  
   - Added: "You MUST respond in JSON format"
   - Added: "You MUST respond with a valid JSON object"
   - Added: "NEVER respond with plain text. Always use JSON format"

3. **Validator** - Line 2364
   - Added: "You MUST respond in JSON format"
   - Added: "NEVER respond with plain text. Always use JSON format"

4. **Supervisor** - Line 2380
   - Added: "You MUST respond in JSON format"  
   - Added: "NEVER respond with plain text. Always use JSON format with {\"response\": \"...\"}"

5. **Query Refiner** - Line 2307
   - Added: "You MUST respond in JSON format"
   - Added: "NEVER respond with plain text. Always use JSON format"

### Pattern Used

Every agent persona now includes:
```python
"""You are a [role description]. You MUST respond in JSON format.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
...
[instructions specific to agent]
...
X. NEVER respond with plain text. Always use JSON format."""
```

## Testing

After this fix, agents will:
1. âœ… Always include "json" in their system prompt
2. âœ… Satisfy Azure OpenAI API requirements
3. âœ… Understand they must respond in JSON format
4. âœ… Not return empty responses due to API errors

## Files Modified

- `app_mcp.py` - Updated 5 agent personas in `AGENT_PERSONAS` dict

## What This Fixes

Your specific error:
```
Loop 1: Error executing task for Writer: Error code: 400 - 
{'error': {'message': "'messages' must contain the word 'json' in some form..."}}
```

Now the Writer (and all other agents) will work correctly with Azure OpenAI's JSON mode.

- Agent Personas: See `AGENT_PERSONAS` dict in `app_mcp.py` (starting line ~2252)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy** - The fix is ready
2. **Test** - Try the same F-35 manpower query
3. **Monitor** - Check that agents respond with JSON

The error should be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
