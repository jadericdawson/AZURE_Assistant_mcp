# ✅ SQLite-Backed Scratchpad System - COMPLETE

## What Was Implemented

### 1. SQLite Persistence (`scratchpad.db`)
- **3 tables**: `pads`, `sections`, `version_history`
- All scratchpad data persisted to disk
- Session-based isolation (multiple sessions can coexist)
- Automatic schema creation on first run

### 2. Diff Visualization (Git-Style)
Every write operation now returns a diff showing:
```diff
+ Added line (green in most terminals)
- Removed line (red in most terminals)
  Context line (unchanged)
```

### 3. Version History Tracking
- Every edit saves:
  - Old content
  - New content
  - Unified diff
  - Agent name (who made the change)
  - Timestamp
  - Operation type (`write_replace`, `write_append`, `insert_lines`, etc.)

### 4. New Tool: `scratchpad_history()`
Agents can now view:
- Who changed what
- When changes were made
- Line-by-line diffs for each version
- Complete audit trail

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE pads (
    pad_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id TEXT,
    pad_name TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    last_modified TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(session_id, pad_name)
);

CREATE TABLE sections (
    section_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    pad_id INTEGER,
    section_name TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    last_modified TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (pad_id) REFERENCES pads(pad_id),
    UNIQUE(pad_id, section_name)
);

CREATE TABLE version_history (
    version_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    section_id INTEGER,
    operation TEXT,
    old_content TEXT,
    new_content TEXT,
    diff TEXT,
    agent_name TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (section_id) REFERENCES sections(section_id)
);
```

## Example Agent Workflow with Diffs

### Agent Writes Initial Content
```python
# Writer creates introduction
scratchpad_write("output", "intro", "# F-35 Report\n\nBackground info.", agent_name="Writer")
```

**Returns:**
```diff
✅ Wrote to 'output.intro' (mode: replace)

@@ -0,0 +1,3 @@
+ # F-35 Report
+ 
+ Background info.
```

### Agent Appends More Content
```python
# Engineer adds findings
scratchpad_write("output", "intro", "Key finding: 42% improvement.", mode="append", agent_name="Engineer")
```

**Returns:**
```diff
✅ Wrote to 'output.intro' (mode: append)

@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
  # F-35 Report
  
  Background info.
+ Key finding: 42% improvement.
```

### View Complete History
```python
scratchpad_history("output", "intro", limit=10)
```

**Returns:**
```markdown
# Version History for 'output.intro'

## Version 1 - 2025-10-04 18:59:46
**Operation:** write_replace  
**Agent:** Writer  

```diff

## Version 2 - 2025-10-04 18:59:47

## Benefits

### ✅ Persistence
- Scratchpads survive app restarts
- Can review agent work after session ends
- Database can be backed up/archived

### ✅ Transparency
- See exactly what changed with each edit
- Track which agent made which changes
- Understand evolution of the output document

### ✅ Debugging
- If output looks wrong, check version history
- See what Agent X added vs Agent Y
- Identify when/where errors were introduced

### ✅ Collaboration
- Multiple agents can see each other's changes
- Diffs make it clear what was added/removed
- No confusion about who wrote what

## Addressing the Token Overflow Issue

The error you're seeing (`generated text empty due to character limit`) happens when:

1. The Writer agent tries to generate a 550-600 word document in one response
2. This exceeds the model's output token limit (~4096 tokens)

### Solution: Incremental Building

Instead of asking Writer to generate the entire document at once, use the scratchpad's **line-level operations** to build it incrementally:

```python
# Loop 1: Writer creates title page
scratchpad_write("output", "title", "# F-35 Manpower Project Report...")

# Loop 2: Writer adds executive summary (2 paragraphs only)
scratchpad_write("output", "executive_summary", "## Executive Summary\n\n...")

# Loop 3: Writer adds background (3-4 paragraphs)
scratchpad_write("output", "background", "## Background\n\n...")

# Loop 4: Writer adds objectives
scratchpad_write("output", "objectives", "## Objectives\n\n...")

# etc...
```

Each write is small (~100-200 words), well within token limits, and the scratchpad assembles them into the final document.

### Updated Orchestrator Strategy

Instead of:
> "Writer: Generate entire 550-word report"

Use:
> "Writer: Create title page section in OUTPUT pad"
> "Writer: Create executive summary section in OUTPUT pad (2 paragraphs only)"
> "Writer: Create background section in OUTPUT pad"

Each task is small and specific, avoiding token limits.

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Update Orchestrator Prompt
Modify the Orchestrator persona to break large writing tasks into smaller sections:

```python
AGENT_PERSONAS["Orchestrator"] = """
...
**IMPORTANT FOR LARGE DOCUMENTS:**
- Break writing tasks into small sections (< 200 words each)
- Have Writer create one section at a time in OUTPUT pad
- Each section is a separate tool call to scratchpad_write()
- Final document is assembled from all sections
..."""
```

### Option 2: Add "Incremental Writer" Agent
Create a specialized agent that knows to write documents section-by-section:

```python
"IncrementalWriter": """You build documents section by section.
1. Review the outline in OUTLINE pad
2. Write ONE section at a time (max 200 words)
3. Use scratchpad_write() for each section
4. Report which section you just wrote
5. Wait for next section assignment"""
```

## Testing

Run the test to verify everything works:

```bash
cd /home/jadericdawson/Documents/AI/AGENTS
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '.')
# Test code here
"
```

Check the database:
```bash
ls -lh scratchpad.db test_scratchpad.db
```

## Summary

✅ **Scratchpads are now persisted to SQLite**  
✅ **Every change tracked with full diffs**  
✅ **`+added` and `-removed` lines shown inline**  
✅ **Version history accessible via `scratchpad_history()`**  
✅ **Agent names tracked for accountability**  
✅ **Timestamps for all changes**  

The database file `scratchpad.db` will be created in the working directory when the app runs.
